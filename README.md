# tg21.github.io
tg21.github.io is just a simple static website I made to serve as my portfolio website on GitHub pages. \
I made This website responsive without using any third-party libraries like bootstrap or foundation.

### Feel free to use it for your github portfolio website.

## TODOs
- Make seperate Webpages for my projects.
- Make it more responsive.
- Test it on Mozilla, safari and Internet Explorer.(Currrently only tested on Chromium based browsers.)
- Make LOGOs for my projects.
